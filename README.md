# DSBAPI Swift implementation

Hello guys :)

Today I try to implement my own [npm](https://github.com/TheNoim/DSBAPI) module with swift. It is still Work in Progress and not useable at the moment.

If you need to fetch something from the dsb use my javascript module -> [Link](https://github.com/TheNoim/DSBAPI)

### Documentation

### Note
At the moment you can't use this as an pod library. If 1024jp releases his swift4 branch I move this library to [this](https://github.com/TheNoim/SwiftyDSB) repo and release it as pod.
